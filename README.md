#Description
Hello, I'm sorry for this being messy. The two files that might be interesting to you are app.py -the main python file that hosts the flask server- and 
PythonBigTech.html -which is the HTML file that I load to display the data in a nice way.

#Usage
Okay if you want to see some cool things, go to http://latinlocator.com:5000/hub.

#Rules:
-exit out of window when you are finished (my pi will suffer!)
-don't click the lights too much, it gets really old (especially at night!)
